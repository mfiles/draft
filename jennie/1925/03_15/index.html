            Dearest Nico,
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            Though it is quite late, and your “little thing” ought to be going to bed, I just felt that I had to write you at least a few lines tonight, not having written you since last Wednesday.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            Mary and I have just returned from the station, having accompanied your brother to the train. Yes, he did finally come to see us, and we certainly enjoyed having him. We did all sorts of things;  jumped rope like the kids, played Tag (Toppo), and took a walk. We also had a darling little girl down here all afternoon and evening. She is only six years old, but just as intelligent and entertaining as she can be. All in all, we all had a good time, at least I think your brother enjoyed himself, except for the fact that he seemed to think he was giving us too much trouble. Just like you in that respect!

            I haven’t been myself this past week. It doesn’t seem to me that I am well, and yet, I am not really ill, except for headaches and I haven’t any color. Perhaps it is the change of season, and then - perhaps your being away has something to do with it. But let’s hope I will get used to it after a while. At this season of the year I always get so tired of sitting at an old desk all day, banging on a typewriter, taking diction, etc. I usually get new ideas about the kind of work I would like to do. For instance, for the past week I’ve been thinking that I’d like to get a position as governess, taking care of little children. But then I usually finally decide that my job isn’t so bad after all. It may be that this is only another form of Spring Fever.

            I received another letter from Alfred yesterday in answer to my letter, quite a long one, in which he describes his trip and now he says that their orders are changed so often he doesn’t know exactly where they are going.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            Dad cut off his mustache today and looks so funny. We all kidded him about it, so much that I think he will allow it to grow again.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            Nothing very interesting has happened this week. I’ve been staying home every single evening, except for the Lenten Devotions I attend every Tuesday and Friday. It isn’t that I didn’t have the opportunity;  I had several invitations, Barbara invited me one evening, Marian wanted me to spend the week-end with her and other things, but I haven’t been in the mood, as I told you before.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            How are you, Nico? Are you happy, and are you beginning to feel that the future holds something for you? Knowing you as I do, I feel confident that you will advance quickly just as soon as you get your license, for men like you are not easy to find. I’m not flattering you, dear, thought I haven’t known you very long, I feel that you are untiring in your efforts just so long as you know that you are on the right track, you have high ideals, no bad habits except smoking, and that is a common one with every man, and I believe you are faithful to your duty. I could say some more nice things about you, but Im afraid you might get a big head. I do hope that you don’t get some of those discouraged feelings any more, as you did on your last trip. I must feel in a preachy mood tonight, I could go on writing like this for pages, but you would get tired reading. To make it short, if it makes you feel any better, try to feel that I am with you wholly in spirit, always thinking of you and praying for you. (I can just see you laughing now). I know you think it is foolish, but this morning I prayed for you all during Mass, and lit a candle for you. If you only knew what a gift prayer is, Nico! It makes one feel so much more light-hearted and gives troubles, etc. a different aspect. But I know you are laughing at me again and thinking what a little fool I am.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            Here it is twelve o’clock, and I’m not in bed yet! When you are home your own dear self keeps me up and when you are away you keep me up writing to you. I’ll say good-night then, dear and shall finish this letter sometime this week. I don’t want dad to find me up when he comes home.

            Your little girl was so ill when she reached the office this morning that she was sent to the doctor. They sent me to Dr. Lund, the company physician, and was told that I am very nervous, that I have indigestion, due to certain acids contained in raw fruits, which buy the way, I have been eating a great deal of believing that they were good for me, and to the lack of exercise. He said that I must learn to relax and rest, that I must not always “be doing something” as I have in the past.

            I’m going to take my first piano lesson Thursday evening. I went up to see the music professor this evening who has the reputation of being very good, but at the same time very strict. Please don’t expect too much of me now Nico. You know, it takes a long time to really learn to play anything. At first it is just exercises without any melody at all. The lessons are rather expensive, so I’ve decided that if after a reasonable period of time I don’t seem to be making any progress I’m going to discontinue them. I haven’t saved as much money in the past as I should have, but just as soon as I have paid up for those few pieces of furniture I bought for the living room, which will be by May, and finished paying my shares, I’m going to save Five dollars a week. Of course that isn’t very much, but it mounts up to Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars in a year.

            The whole family is sitting around the table making it almost impossible to write, so I must leave you. I’d better go to bed early tonight anyway, so that I’ll feel better tomorrow. I shall write you again as soon as I have the opportunity.

            Eight days since I wrote my own dear Nico! And if I don’t hurry and finish this letter you will be leaving Pedro without receiving it.

            I am spending the week-end at Marian’s house. Yesterday afternoon she and I went to see “The Guardsman,” a very clever drama then had supper together and went down to “Terntown,” a terrible place, for Marian wanted to do some shopping. You can buy very good things down there much more reasonably, but you have to make them come down in their price.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            It is wonderful outdoors today. I wish you and I could be together. To me, it seems as if you have been away so long, I can’t wait until you return.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            I’ve been a very good girl this week; went out only one evening, and I then just went for a swim with one of my girl friends and came home early. Every other night (darn this pen) I was in bed by ten-thirty and I feel better because of it. I'm beginning to feel more like myself and my color is coming back thank heavens. For a while everybody was saying I looked terrible.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            I took my first music lesson Thursday evening. Mr. Hartung, my teacher is a a very nervous, high-strung man and I’m afraid he almost lost his patience with me already;  I was so stupid.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            They are calling me for dinner so I shall close and mail this letter sometime this afternoon. I’d love to go for a long walk along the board-walk down at Coney Island, but Marian wants to go for an automobile ride. She always has her own way with me, so I suppose we will go for a ride.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            I shall be looking for a long letter from you around the last of the month, so please don’t disappoint me. Send it by air mail, will you, if you have the chance.
            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0px;">
              With all my love,
              <br><div class="tab"></div>

            This poem I just happened to find in one of Marian’s books:
          	<br><div class="tab"></div>
            O days and hours, your work is this
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
          	To hold me from my proper place,
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
          	A little while from his embrace,
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
          	For fuller ga? of after bliss,
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
          	That out of distance night ensue
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
          	Desire of nearness doubly sweet
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
          	And until meeting when we meet,
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
          	Delight a hundredfold accrue
