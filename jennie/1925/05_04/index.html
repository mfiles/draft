            My own darling Nico,
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            You know, you are really a perfect dear to have sent me that radio message, which I have just received. I guess it was a case of us both longing for each other yesterday – I could not keep my mind off you yesterday, in spite of the fact that I was occupied every minute.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            I am writing this up in my own room, in the most uncomfortable position for if I write downstairs, the family will inquire  “Who are you writing to now – Nick again?” and when I acknowledge it, they will only laugh at me.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            There isn't a great deal of interest to tell you dear, so, if you don't object, I am going to tell you how I spent the week-end, from beginning to end.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            On Saturday I didn't leave the office until about 130. There was a sale of shoes at Wanamaker's so I went down there and bought the daintiest pair of slippers for how much do you think only $3.25. Wasn't that a bargain, and, they are a real good quality of standard make. After that, I went to the agency to pay the second installment. Next week, thank heavens, I am through with that. Then I had to go to the bank, and after that, I went to Macy's to see if I could find some suitable material to cover over an old chair which we have neglected from somewhere. I got all tired out, hunting around without any success and didn't reach home until five o’clock. At home I found Mr. and Mrs. Hlocka of whom I have told you several times, I think, with their two little children. (Mrs. Hlocka is the cousin of that Slav girl, Cyrilla, whom you met at our house one time.) They asked me if I wouldn't go with them the following evening to see an opera in which Mr. Savine, quite a noted musician and dramatic professor, has written, entitled “Xena". I accepted and will tell you about it later when they went, I had to get supper, ready, for Mary and mother we're going to the movies. After supper, Irma and I had to go to town to go to confession, and at the same time to do some shopping. On the way home what do you think happened? Though it was only about 9:30 one of those men whom I told you about tried to follow us. Irma noticed him first, so we started to run and asked a woman and girl who were ahead of us if we might walk with them. We lost the man in someway, or perhaps he became frightened when we ran ahead with that woman. Of course, we weren't badly frightened, because there were two of us, and we really could have run away easily enough, but that is the end of my going out all alone at night. I'm going to be mighty careful in the future. When I reached home, I made a cake, and didn't get to bed until quite late, as usual.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            Sunday was a lovely day. When I came home from Mass, I put on some very old clothes and worked in the garden. I seeded four different varieties of flowers and some pansy plants. I hope they come up all right. We are trying to make the place attractive this year. Dad has promised to screen the porch, and if he does, I am going to cover some very old furniture we have in the attic with some very gayly decorated material and fix up the porch nicely. It will be a nice place for you and me when you come home on warm summer evenings, that is, when everybody will have gone to bed. We had the Hlocka family to dinner, which meant, of course, quite a bit of work, and in the afternoon, we had quite a bit of fun with Dolores and Vera, their two little children, who are perfectly darling. You, I'm afraid, would have been disgusted if you had seen the way I wrapped with those kiddies. Dolores and I  coasted down the hill in Eddie's express wagon, and did all sorts of silly things. After that, I went to Mrs. Hlocka's house with them and helped her with the children. She has a very attractive little house, my ideal type, small and cosy, and because of her artistic ability has made it very pretty indeed. She is quite talented: she paints, models in clay, and sometimes writes short stories.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            In the evening we went to see Xenia, in which her husband took a part and enjoyed it quite well. Although it was given in this, Mr's Devine studio, which has a very small stage, they had 25 people in the orchestra. I think the story would have appealed to you. It was really quite unusual. The scene was supposed to have been laid in Bosnia on the border of turkey. I met some very interesting people there, one in particular, a very charming American, whose name is Dr. Morton. During the war she was working for the Red Cross in the part of Austria that Cyrilla comes from I think.  While there she became very much interested in some young Slavs, whom she brought back to America and educated, and who have succeeded she told us. She has in a way adopted these people, and keeps in touch with them all the time, going back to Europe once in a while to see them. She seems particularly interested in the Slavs, somehow. She even knows how to speak the language to a certain extent. With her was quite a famous actress, also very charming and so interested in people in general. This doctor Morton invited Mrs. Hlocka and me to a tea she is giving on the 11th to which I am anxious to go if Mrs. Hlocka goes also. The worst part of the whole thing however, was that we missed the last train, having to go home by trolley, and didn't get to bed until 330. You can imagine how I felt today – perfectly wretched, so I am going to bed shortly after I finish writing you tonight.

            Alfred just called up. The poor boy is so disappointed. He was looking forward to seeing his brother this time, and just found out that he is not on that ship this trip. He says that this will be his last trip on the “Aguilay.”
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            The office manager told me today that he thinks I will get at least a weeks vacation and that he would try to get two weeks for me if he possibly could. Isn't that fine, when I am not really entitled to any. Wouldn't it be wonderful if I could take one week off during the time you plan to be home? We could take hikes and have little picnics all alone. It is so much nicer on weekdays, you know, because there aren't so many people. We could start out real early in the morning, our lunch packed in a box, and our bathing suits tucked under our arms, go swimming and have perfectly delightful times. Now, please don't get frightened dear. I didn't mean that we would necessarily have to go to places where we would have to spend very much. We could have a good time on very little. But really, I hardly think it is possible that they would let me have my vacation as early as that. I will have last choice, being the newest member of the firm, while in the other place, I would have had first choice. But if I can't have it, then we can be together in the evenings. There is quite a delightful boat trip to Coney Island, in the summer, which we could take just for the sake of the boat ride. Then there is the Mandalay boats that go to the Atlantic Highlands. They are quite nice – have music on board and a place where you can dance. Of course, that means that I won't get any sleep and I'll be a wreck in a week, doesn't it? That is the worst of it all, Nico. The little time we do get together is of such short duration.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            I wonder where you are this minute. Last week at this time we were together, do you remember? You are now, I imagine, about halfway down to the canal, which is, say, around the coast of Florida. Am I right?
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            Tomorrow night, there is going to be a little dance at the Jugo Slav club, to which Sorella and Barbara Cokes me to go, and really, to which I was thinking of going just for the fun of it, but I have changed my mind. You know how I love to dance, don't you? I dance just for the joy of it, not, as some people might think to have the opportunity of dancing with a man, for I often enjoy dancing with a girl if she leads well more than with a man. But when I considered the fact that I would again lose sleep, I thought it would be a better idea to stay home. Am I not getting sensible dear? You must not be jealous, though, Nico, dear, if I should happen to go once in a while, for if I should stay home all the time I would become dreadfully dull and gloomy, and you don't want me to be that way, do you? Of course, there are lots of other things that I can get quite a bit of pleasure out of. For instance, yesterday, just romping with those kiddies, satisfied me, and I really got quite a lot of fun out of working in the garden. I'm a strange person, don't you think, dear? I do – sometimes I can't understand myself.

            Our lilacs are starting to bloom now – they are beautiful and so fragrant. If I get the chance, I should like very much to bring your mother a bouquet before they are gone. They last only about a week in the spring.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            I must close now, for it is already nine o'clock and I had promised myself I would be in bed by nine.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            Good-night my own darling man – I love you so much.
            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0px;">
              Your own,
              <br><div class="tab"></div>
