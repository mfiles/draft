              At Home,<br>
              December 4th, 1925.
            </div>
            Dearest Nico,
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            I’m so glad I saw you this afternoon before you left. It seems that we have seen so little of each other this time, Let us hope that it will be different next time - and it will be - as far as I am concerned.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            There is so much I want to say, Nico, but I’m afraid that you are going to consider anything I say or write henceforth without meaning and insincere, at least you intimated as much today. But I can hardly blame you after all. I know that I have been heartless and exceedingly selfish.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            First of all, I want to promise you that there will be no further worrying on my part, for I feel confident now (really I do, Nico - our last experience, though a painful one for you - and me too after I had realized how much I had hurt you - has convinced me) that your love is the real sort and worth much more than anything else in the world. I realize how hard it is going to be for you to wipe out of your memory what I wrote you but won’t you <span style="text-decoration: underline">please</span> try to forget and forgive. I promise you that you will not have a similar experience again. You can’t imagine how small I felt (I don't mean size this time) when you made me see how petty and unimportant the grievances I had against you were in reality. That was the reason for my silence last night. I understood then how entirely wrong I had been in entertaining such ideas.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            Nico, dearest, if it is in my power to make you happy - to at least ease the memory of the troubles you have had and the difficulties you are to encounter in the future - you may count on m e to do all that I possibly can. Thought it pained me last night when you told me that you had expected me to give you happiness, and that instead I was making you more miserable than ever, it awakened in me a new and sweet responsibility. I can see now that my outlook on love has been a selfish one, for I expected you to do everything in your power in an effort to make me happy just because you are a man, when, naturally, it ought to be mutual, both of us working to the same end. You know, I think it was because as I have already told you, I believe that I have so often read and been told that a woman is foolish to give too much to a man, for the more she gives, the less he appreciates her. I feared that if I showed that I cared a great deal, you would grow tired of me in a short time. You must admit that that is not exactly ban absurd conclusion, for you have certainly in your life seen and read of many such cases. I am so glad that I know that you don't feel that way, for I want to love and be loved to the fullest possible extent. You know that it is natural for me to be that way.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            What kind of weather did you have on your way down? I expect that this trip will have been a stormy one, for I read in the newspaper that bad weather is to be expected along the coast. I do hope that you are taking care of your cold and getting enough sleep, however. Tell Alfred that I hope he is keeping after you with respect to the medicine for your cold. I think I must have caught cold last night for my whole right side ached all day.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            I didn’t even have a chance to tell you about the way I spent last Sunday except to say that I was at Barbara’s house. Really, Nico, it was great fun having the baby to myself - he is such a dear little thing, and didn’t cry until around the time his Mother came home. I dressed him myself and took him out for a long walk, Really, I felt quite natural, and wondered if I would ever have the happiness of motherhood. I met my friend Alice at the subway, and then went back to the apartment. We had such a good, cozy time, playing records and planning our future homes. (Alice, you know, and her fiancé are in the same boat we are in as far as lack of funds are concerned and getting married). He has had quite a serious operation performed on his back and has been in the hospital for about ten weeks. I think, in fact, that they are worse off than we for he is inclined to be rather sickly, I think.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            Last Saturday afternoon I spent shopping for Christmas gifts for the girls and getting an idea on prices. I bought material for both Mary and Irma to make dresses, but now the difficulty is, how am I to make the dresses when the girls are always around, and naturally, I want to surprise them. In the evening I met Alice, and we went to a cute, quiet little place for super, then to the theatre to see Shakespeare’s famous “Hamlet” played by quite a prominent cast, Don't you think I’m getting extravagant, Nico? I paid $2.20 for my ticket. I consider that it is worth while to pay for something of that sort, for it is something I shall never forget and really quite educational. I know you would have enjoyed it. Nico, sometime, when you happen to be in the city several days and we have the time, let’s go to see some musical play or something of that sort. There are several good operettas playing now, and we could get seats where we could hear and see well enough for $1.20 each. I don't mind going to the second balcony at all, for I have often gone. They say that “Princess Flavia”, an operetta which is based on “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Flavia" target="_blank">The Prisoner of Zenda</a>” is good, also “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vagabond_King" target="_blank">The Vagabond King</a>.” Now, you must not worry about this Nico dearest, for, naturally, I don't want you to go if you can’t spare the money.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            Tomorrow evening the Jugo-Slav Club is giving a concert and dance. I had been thinking of going, but I have changed my mind. Irma is coming down to the city and we are going shopping to get her a new coat. How I dread it, for the shops are so awfully crowded. As to Sunday, I haven’t decided how I shall spend it. I think your brother is coming up, perhaps Antonietta too, for I asked him to bring her along. I do hope this weather changes. It is still raining. It must be miserable on board. Let me think now, you must be at this moment in bed sleeping and somewhere around Atlantic City or are you further South? Surely, it doesn’t take seven hours to get to Atlantic City. 
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            Nico, you know, I understand every word that you wrote me in Italian. Of course, I had to read it over more than once before I could get the meaning. I had another Italian letter to translate the other day. It wasn’t a difficult one, however, just the usual one about seeking to represent our firm. I think I shall have to get myself an Italian-English dictionary for future use. 
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            Miss Pasche, the Swiss girl in the office and I are getting along famously. I shall hate to see her leave.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            The other night when I mentioned “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quo_Vadis_(novel)" target="_blank">Quo Vadis</a>” to you, you seemed to think that it wasn’t much for a book - that you had read it when you were a boy. I think you could fully appreciate it now Nico. I think it is a wonderful story. As a boy, you naturally were thrilled by the adventure and the historical part of the story, but now you would also appreciate the beauty of it, especially of the two main characters, Vinicius and Lygia. Do you remember them? And do you remember Peter? You must admit that he was a beautiful character. 
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            Gosh, it’s cold in this room, and getting late. Though I went to bed quite late last night, I didn’t feel a bit tired today.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            I trust that this letter won’t be delayed as the last one, but that you will receive it on your arrival. I do hope that it will find you in a cheerful frame of mind. I shall be looking for a letter from you by, let me see, about Saturday.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            I’m looking forward to your next stay in New York very much Nico dearest. If you should arrive in the evening, I will try to meet you.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            The clock has just struck eleven so I must leave you and get to bed. Good-night my own dear boy.
            
            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0px;">
              Always your own loving
