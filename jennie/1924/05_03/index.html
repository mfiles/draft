            Dear Nico,
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            I was certainly very much surprised when I came home the evening you called up, to hear that you were sailing for South Africa. What made you change your mind? Now, I suppose we won’t see each other for about six months, and then the summer will have passed and we won’t be able to go to Rockaway as we planned. But the trip will be fine for you and Alfred;  you will have the opportunity of learning English well if you have an English speaking crew.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            We have been having some very lovely weather, and then again, some very rainy weather. I do hope you won’t have very stormy weather at sea. When you write me, don’t forget to tell me all about the trip, the people on board, the weather, etc. It will all be interesting to me for, as you know, I have never been at sea.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            I am feeling quite myself again, thank heavens. It was quite warm today, so Mary, Irma and I played ball a while this afternoon, Our place looks lovely now, all the peach trees are in blossom, and soon the apple trees will be blossoming. It is a very beautiful sight indeed.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            As you know, my birthday was on the 28th of April, and we celebrated a bit. The evening before (la vigilia) George, (you met him, I believe) his mother, my santola, Barbara and her fiancé, came over, bringing flowers and candy, and we had quite a nice little party. Then on Monday, the following evening we celebrated a little more.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            Whatever you do, Nico, don’t go into any of the forests of Africa and be eaten alive by some lion or tiger. There are some very ferocious animals down there, are there not?
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            A friend of mine and I have joined the Y.W.C.A. Swimming pool in New York, and expect to go swimming at least once a week in the future. I believe Mary intends to join as well.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            As I expect a friend in a few minutes, I shall close now, hoping to hear from you soon. Were you able to read this awful handwriting? It seems to me that I could write much better when I was a child.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            Best regards to Alfred and from Mary to you and Alfred.
            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0px;">
              Sincerely,
              <br><div class="tab"></div>
							Jennie

            P.S. Dad gave me your letter this morning. Mary didn’t seem to understand you over the ‘phone the evening you called, but on looking over the steamship news in the newspaper, we found that the “Eastern Glade” must be the ship of the Mallory Line going to Cape Town. However I am glad you wrote for it confirms our supposition.
