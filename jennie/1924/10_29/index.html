              The Office<br>
              October 29th, 1924
            </div>
            Dear Nico,
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            I am writing this as you will note from the above, in the office, awaiting Alfred. He called me on the ‘phone today, saying that he wouldn’t be able to see me this trip as they were to leave at three o’clock this afternoon but about five o’clock he called me again saying that they were leaving tomorrow morning and asking if he might not meet me this evening and have supper with him. We are to meet at 6:30, hence, the time to write you.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            I have so much to say, and so little time to say it. First of all, I want to tell you about Barbara’s wedding. It was a beautiful ceremony;  the organ played divinely and there was a tenor who sang beautifully. Four priests were on the altar, one of them having come all the way from Baltimore to attend the wedding. Barbara looked lovely in her white bridal gown and veil and carried a bouquet of roses and lilies of the valley, while I was dressed in orchid and carried chrysanthemums of the same color. We travelled all the way from Leonia to Brooklyn, and after the ceremony and photographs had been taken [we] had to travel back to Leona for the luncheon. We had lots of fun. They have departed for the South, where I don’t know exactly, but I believe wither the West Indies or the Panama Canal for Barbara said it took five days be boat to reach their destination.

            I have been having quite a good time lately. The past two Sundays a man in our neighborhood who owns an aeroplane had taken me up with him. I enjoyed it immensely and was not a bit afraid. Irma and Mary have also been up. Last Sunday some friends of ours, Irma’s Godmother Mrs. Adomich, her married daughter who lives in Harrisburg and some friends of theirs in passing through came down to visit us, and on the way back took Mary, Irma and myself part way back. Mrs. Adomich’s married nephew who lives near us brought us back in his car. Then one Sunday this month, Alice, her “sposo,” his friend and myself went up the Hudson by boat. It was a perfectly beautiful day and on the way home there was a full moon. I wish you had been my escort instead of the man I had - I know you would have enjoyed it and appreciated it. I have been taking some long walks, for the country is beautiful at this time of year and we have been having ideal weather.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            Didn’t I tell you in my last letter that I was going to this school of vocational guidance or character reading? I believe I did. Well, I went and was told some things about myself that I never knew but which after an analysis of myself, found were very true indeed.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            I don’t believe you will find me working in the same place when you come home in January. I have lost absolutely all interest for my work, and when that happens, it is time to look for a better position.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            As I won’t see you before Christmas, I want to send you my best wishes for a happy holiday. I know it won’t be much like Christmas being away from everybody, but I shall be thinking of you and hoping you are not too depressed. Try to cultivate the habit of being happier, Nick. I truly believe that if you had a little faith in God, that you would be much happier. It is that way with me. A few weeks ago I had been feeling very gloomy and morbid so I went to St. Patrick’s Cathedral for a little while and prayed very hard. I came out feeling so much better. This sounds like regular grand-motherly advice doesn’t it, but I don’t mean it to be.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            It is getting near the time for meeting Alfred so I will have to close. I know that he would want me to send you his best regards, so I shall send them now.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            Be good and let me hear from you sometime.
            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0px;">
              Sincerely,
              <br><div class="tab"></div>
              Jennie
            </div>
            I haven’t any photographs to send you as I haven’t had any taken. Sorry.
