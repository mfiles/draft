              East London, June 9th
            </div>
            Dear Jennie,
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            before leaving Cape Town, I received with much pleasure your letter of the 5th of the last month. I haven’t had time enough to write you from there, so, I am answering you from this port.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            I am very grateful to you knowing that you didn’t forget me, and I hope you will remember me in the future, at least once in a while.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            I wrote you a postcard from Cape Town, but, as I want sure of your address (I didn’t know your house number), so, I sent it in the c/o of my mother. But from now on I shall write you with the address you wrote me in your letter.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            In Cape Town we stayed only four days, and in this harbor we are going to remain about the same period. From here we shall go to Durban, Delagoa Bay, Beira and probably some other ports of the Eastern Coast of South Africa, afterwards we have to come back to Cape Town where we’ll stay nearly ten days. Then our homeward trip will begin and I hope to be back in the States around the middle of August. We will not come right away to New York because probably they will send us to New Orleans another ports of the Eastern Coast, so that I won’t be at home before the month of September. If there will be any changes in what port of America we are bound for, I’ll let you know.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            As you see it will take a long time for the round trip and we won’t see each other for several months. The summer will be over since then, notwithstanding you won’t be able to go to Rockaway and theater Beaches because you have lots of friends, so I hope you will enjoy with them the Summer season.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            I guess you will see often Alfred if he is navigating for Central America as we planned before. About what happened to him the last moment before departure you don’t need any explanation from me because you will know everything about it. I tell you only that I am awfully sorry that happened because I lost a real friend;  but I hope him all right now and I should be glad to know him content if he joined any ship.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            Now I am going to tell you something about the trip:
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            We stayed almost one month in the ocean and the trip was a wonderful one, except some rainy and windy days along the equator. We have had many and many lovely nights with the moon shining those golden rays in the calm sea…something of beautiful indeed, a sight that we can’t have ashore, but only in the open ocean. In few words there was a real “romance in it.”
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            On board there are generally English speaking fellows, among them many to whom I like to talk with because [they are] fine and educated too, so that I find myself pretty content of the situation.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            I am glad to know you rejoined your health and that you enjoy yourself going swimming and other sports.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            You are telling me about your birthday and the fine time you have had in that occasion. Now I remember we were talking about that almost two weeks before the 28th last, but, as you know, in those days I was very busy and therefore I forgot about it. I am sorry I didn’t at least sent you my wishes, but I hope you will understand me, will you? Then you wrote me about George, “Santolo,” Barbara and her fiancé, but believe me I couldn’t find out who they were, I never heard those names before.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            I thank you very much for the snapshot you sent me, and I shall be very glad to see you in some other picture with your bobbed hairs, as you promised me.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            Now we come about the lions, tigers and other ferocious animals. I know you wrote that for fun, anyway it made me laugh; You well know that the “Eastern Glade” is not going in the middle of Africa where you can still find those kind of beasts.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            Here indeed, in the Southern part, there are very nice places. Cape Town for instance is a fine city where I didn’t expect to enjoy myself as I did. There are many nice English theaters, where I saw some lovely American picture and vaudeville. They played American jazz music too, which I enjoyed very much, and it seemed to me to be in some Broadway theater, though I was almost seven thousand miles from there.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            One day, when I was off, in company of a young fellow whom I like, I took a raid in the train towards a place along the seashore about forty miles from the city. We enjoyed some beautiful sights that made me remembered my lovely Lussino with its nature’s masterpieces.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            I guess now, I wrote enough and God knows how many mistakes you will find out. Anyway I hope you will not criticize my writing because you know my knowledge of the English language.
            <br><div class="tab"></div>
            I close with my best regards to you, Mary and everybody at home.
            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0px;">
              Sincerely,
              <br><div class="tab"></div>
